Heart failure is a serious condition in which the heart is unable to produce enough blood to supply the entire body. Approximately 6.2 million adults in the United States have heart failure. In 2018, close to 400,000 deaths across the United States were associated with heart failure [1].

The dataset used in this study was from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and was collected by Krembil Research Institute, Canada. All patients in the dataset were from Pakistan, and data were collected from a specific time of April to December 2015 [2].

Death of heart failure is associated with location [1]. Prior to this dataset, there were few studies related to heart failure in Pakistani, so this dataset is of great importance.

The goal of this study is to select appropriate features and models to predict survival in heart failure based on this dataset. This will enable hospitals to have a clearer picture of the patientsâ€™ condition when admitting them and make appropriate preparations and treatment plans.
